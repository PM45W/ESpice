# EPC-Co.com Scraper Status

## Current Status: ✅ Working with Mock Data

### What's Working:
- ✅ Backend service is running on port 8011
- ✅ All API endpoints are functional
- ✅ Mock data system works perfectly
- ✅ Frontend integration is complete
- ✅ Dark mode and responsive design implemented

### What's Blocked:
- ❌ Real scraping is blocked by EPC-Co.com's anti-bot protection
- ❌ Returns 403 Forbidden when attempting to scrape real data
- ❌ This is expected behavior from the website

### How to Use:

1. **Start the Backend Service:**
   ```powershell
   cd services/web-scraper
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8011 --reload
   ```

2. **Use the Frontend:**
   - Open the desktop app
   - Go to Products page
   - Click "🔼 Show EPC Interface"
   - **Keep "Use Mock Data" checked** (default)
   - Enter model numbers like "epc2040"
   - Click "🚀 Scrape"

3. **Test Endpoints:**
   ```powershell
   # Test service is running
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:8011/epc/test' -Method GET
   
   # Test mock data
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:8011/epc/test-mock' -Method GET
   ```

### Why Mock Data?
EPC-Co.com implements sophisticated anti-bot protection that:
- Blocks automated requests
- Returns 403 Forbidden errors
- Requires manual browser interaction
- Uses JavaScript-based protection

### Future Improvements:
- Implement browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)
- Add proxy rotation
- Use headless browser with realistic user behavior
- Implement session management
- Add CAPTCHA solving capabilities

### Current Features:
- ✅ Mock product generation
- ✅ Mock datasheet and SPICE model paths
- ✅ Batch processing simulation
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Beautiful UI with dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes

The system is fully functional for demonstration and testing purposes! 🎉
