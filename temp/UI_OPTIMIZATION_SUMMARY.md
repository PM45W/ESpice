- ✅ Added useMemo for static data structures

#### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- ✅ Created usePerformanceMonitor hook
- ✅ Added render time tracking
- ✅ Implemented performance warnings for slow renders
- ✅ Added development-only performance logging

#### 4. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Implemented ErrorBoundary component
- ✅ Added graceful error recovery
- ✅ Enhanced user experience during errors
- ✅ Development-only error details

#### 5. **CSS Optimizations**
- ✅ Reduced contrast for softer appearance (as requested)
- ✅ Optimized animations with will-change property
- ✅ Added reduced motion support
- ✅ Implemented high contrast mode support
- ✅ Removed unused CSS classes

#### 6. **Accessibility Improvements**
- ✅ Added proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Implemented keyboard navigation
- ✅ Enhanced screen reader support
- ✅ Added focus management
- ✅ Improved semantic HTML structure

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### Design System Updates
- **Softer Contrast**: Reduced background contrast from 100% to 99% white

- **Improved Spacing**: Enhanced component spacing and layout
- **Modern Cards**: Replaced custom card classes with shadcn/ui components

### Component Improvements
- **UploadPage**: Enhanced drag-and-drop with better visual feedback
- **DashboardPage**: Optimized with memoized components
- **Layout**: Improved sidebar and header performance
- **Loading States**: Added proper loading spinners and progress indicators

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
```
dist/assets/index-BkAZPK5j.js   383.96 kB │ gzip: 122.67 kB
```

### After Optimization
```
dist/assets/index-BL3XT-GO.js   371.73 kB │ gzip: 121.06 kB
dist/assets/UploadPage-05a80PLn.js    7.23 kB │ gzip:  2.70 kB
dist/assets/DashboardPage-C-VmqJnU.js  7.92 kB │ gzip:  2.59 kB
```

### Benefits
- **Faster Initial Load**: Lazy loading reduces initial bundle
- **Better Caching**: Separated chunks improve cache efficiency
- **Improved Performance**: Memoization reduces unnecessary re-renders
- **Enhanced UX**: Better loading states and error handling
