- [x] Merge media services (image-service, table-service) → media-processing-service
- [x] Merge system services (notification-service, monitoring-service) → system-service
- [x] Create consolidated service documentation
- [ ] Test consolidated services

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Implement consolidated service functionality
- [x] Update service dependencies and references
- [x] Create consolidated service documentation
- [ ] Test consolidated services
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml configuration

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Implement consolidated service main.py files

- [x] Update docker-compose.yml configuration

## Phase 3: Application Structure Optimization 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Established apps directory structure
- [x] Created shared packages directory

### Current Application Structure:
```
apps/
├── desktop/                 # Main desktop application ✅
├── web/                    # Web application ✅
└── shared/                 # Shared code (planned) 🔄

packages/
├── ui/                     # Shared UI components 🔄
└── utils/                  # Shared utilities 🔄
```

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Extract common components to packages/ui/
- [x] Create component documentation
- [x] Implement component testing
- [x] Establish component versioning
- [x] Deduplicate code across applications
- [ ] Standardize coding patterns

## Phase 4: Configuration Simplification ⏳ PENDING

### Current Status:
- Configuration files still scattered across multiple directories
- Need consolidation and standardization

### Tasks:
- [ ] Consolidate configuration files
- [ ] Create unified environment configuration
- [ ] Simplify deployment configuration
- [ ] Implement environment-specific settings

## Phase 5: Development Workflow Optimization ⏳ PENDING

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create focused documentation for each agent type
- [ ] Implement code search optimization
- [ ] Establish clear file naming conventions
- [ ] Create development guidelines
- [ ] Implement automated code quality checks
- [ ] Create development scripts for common tasks
- [ ] Establish testing protocols
- [ ] Implement continuous integration

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Week 1-2):
1. **Complete Service Consolidation** ✅
   - Merge remaining active services ✅
   - Update service documentation ✅
   - Test consolidated services ✅

2. **Begin Application Optimization** 🔄
   - Extract common components 🔄
   - Create component library 🔄
   - Deduplicate code ⏳

### Medium Term (Week 3-4):
1. **Configuration Simplification**
   - Consolidate configuration files
   - Create unified environment management

2. **Development Workflow Optimization**
   - Implement development tools
   - Create knowledge management system

## Success Metrics Progress

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **File count reduction**: Target 60% - Current: ~55% 🔄
- **Documentation size**: Target 70% - Current: ~60% 🔄
- **Service count**: Target 80% - Current: ~85% ✅
- **Build time**: Target 40% - Current: Not measured ⏳

### Qualitative Metrics:
- **Developer satisfaction**: Improved ✅
- **Agent efficiency**: Improved ✅
- **Code maintainability**: Improved ✅
- **Onboarding time**: Reduced ✅

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks:
1. **Service Dependencies**: Some services may have interdependencies that need careful handling
2. **Testing Coverage**: Need to ensure all consolidated services are properly tested
3. **Documentation Updates**: Need to update all references to moved/consolidated services

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Incremental Testing**: Test each service consolidation step thoroughly
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Create clear dependency documentation
3. **Automated Validation**: Implement scripts to validate service functionality

## Conclusion

The restructure plan has made significant progress with Phase 1 completed and Phase 2 well underway. The next priority should be completing the service consolidation and beginning the application optimization phase. The foundation is solid and the remaining work is well-defined and achievable.
