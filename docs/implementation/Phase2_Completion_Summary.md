- **Real-time Preview**: Thumbnail generation for uploaded images
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during upload process

### 2. Image Management Features
- **Metadata Capture**: Filename, description, upload date, file size
- **Image Preview**: Thumbnail display with hover effects
- **Edit Capabilities**: Inline editing of filename and description
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove individual images with confirmation
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status badges (pending, processing, completed, failed)

### 3. Database Integration
- **GraphImage Model**: New database schema for storing image metadata
- **Product Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships with products
- **File Storage**: Local file system path management
- **Metadata Storage**: Comprehensive image information tracking

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- **New Table Column**: Added "Graph Images" column to product table
- **Upload Button**: Quick access to image upload for each product
- **Image Count Display**: Real-time count of uploaded images per product
- **Modal Interface**: Clean, responsive upload modal design
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and validation

## üìÅ New Files Created

### Components
- `apps/desktop/src/components/MultiImageUpload.tsx`
  - Drag-and-drop upload interface
  - Image preview and metadata editing
  - Progress tracking and error handling

- `apps/desktop/src/components/GraphImageGallery.tsx`
  - Image gallery display component
  - Image management (edit, delete, view)
  - Status indicators and metadata display

### Services
- `apps/desktop/src/services/graphImageService.ts`
  - Database operations for graph images
  - File upload and management
  - Integration with extraction jobs

### Enhanced Files
- `apps/desktop/src/pages/ProductManagementPage.tsx`
  - Added Graph Images column
  - Integrated upload functionality
  - Added image management handlers

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```prisma
model GraphImage {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  productId   String
  filename    String
  filePath    String
  uploadDate  DateTime @default(now())
  description String?
  status      String   @default("pending")
  fileSize    Int?
  mimeType    String?
  dimensions  Json?
  product     Product  @relation(fields: [productId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Key Dependencies
- `react-dropzone`: Drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- `lucide-react`: Icon library for UI elements
- `@tauri-apps/api`: Desktop app integration

### State Management
- Product-level image tracking using React state
- Real-time updates for image counts and status
- Modal state management for upload interface

## üéØ User Workflow

1. **Access Upload**: Click the image icon in the Actions column for any product
2. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop multiple image files or click to select
3. **Edit Metadata**: Optionally edit filename and description for each image
4. **Review & Upload**: Preview all images and confirm upload
5. **Monitor Status**: Track upload progress and view results
6. **Manage Images**: Edit, delete, or view full-size images as needed

## üîó Integration Points

### With Phase 1 (Database Schema)
- Utilizes the new `GraphImage` model and relationships
- Integrates with enhanced `Product` model
- Prepares for extraction job creation

### With Phase 3 (Queue Service)
- Images are ready for extraction job creation
- Status tracking aligns with queue processing
- Database integration supports job management

### With Future Phases
- **Phase 4**: Real-time monitoring dashboard will display image processing status
- **Phase 5**: Manual queue management will allow prioritization of image processing
- **Phase 6**: Automatic job creation when images are uploaded

## üìä Performance Considerations

### File Handling
- Client-side image validation and preview generation
- Efficient file size calculation and format checking
- Memory management for large image uploads

### Database Operations
- Optimized queries for image retrieval by product
- Efficient metadata storage and retrieval
- Proper indexing for performance

### UI Responsiveness
- Asynchronous upload operations
- Real-time progress updates
- Non-blocking interface during uploads

## üß™ Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop functionality
- ‚úÖ Multiple file upload
- ‚úÖ File type validation
- ‚úÖ Image preview generation
- ‚úÖ Metadata editing
- ‚úÖ Database integration
- ‚úÖ UI responsiveness

### Integration Testing
- ‚úÖ Product management page integration
- ‚úÖ Database schema compatibility
- ‚úÖ Service layer functionality

## üöÄ Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete and ready for Phase 4 (Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard) implementation. The foundation is now in place for:

1. **Real-time Queue Monitoring**: Display processing status of uploaded images
2. **Manual Queue Management**: Allow users to prioritize and manage extraction jobs
3. **Automatic Job Creation**: Trigger extraction jobs when images are uploaded
4. **SPICE Integration**: Process extracted data for SPICE model generation

## üìù Notes

- The implementation follows the established design system and UI patterns
- Error handling is comprehensive with user-friendly messages
- The code is modular and maintainable for future enhancements
- Performance optimizations are in place for large-scale usage
- The interface is responsive and accessible across different screen sizes
