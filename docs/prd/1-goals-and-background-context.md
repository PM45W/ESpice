# 1. Goals and Background Context

AI-GaN Pro is a desktop platform engineered for R&D teams developing third-generation semiconductor devicesâ€”particularly gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). The primary goal is to automate complex workflows such as datasheet analysis, parameter extraction, and SPICE model generation (ASM-HEMT, MVSG), aiming to reduce development cycle time for GaN/SiC devices by at least 70%.

The platform will incorporate AI-driven tools to extract parameters from over 50 datasheets in batch mode, support high-accuracy curve digitization, and enable seamless export of simulation-ready SPICE models compatible with Cadence and Keysight tools. Another key feature is a real-time web scraper that aggregates GaN/SiC product data directly from manufacturer websites, allowing users to stay updated with current offerings.

AI-GaN Pro is designed to improve both speed and accuracy of semiconductor model creation, positioning itself as a mission-critical tool in a $2.5B+ global GaN power device market.
