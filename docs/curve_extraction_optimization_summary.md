# Curve Extraction Algorithm Optimization Summary

## Executive Summary

After analyzing both the legacy GUI implementation (`curve_extract_gui_legacy.py`) and the current API implementation (`services/curve-extraction-service/main.py`), I've identified and fixed critical issues that prevented the new version from achieving what the legacy version could. The main problems were **over-engineering** and **parameter mismatches** in the current implementation.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Algorithm Divergence**
- **Legacy**: Simple, direct approach with proven effectiveness
- **Current**: Over-engineered with multiple optional features that interfered with core functionality

### 2. **Critical Parameter Differences**
| Parameter | Legacy (Working) | Current API (Problematic) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| `min_size` | Default: 1000 | Default: 1000 (but used differently) |
| Smoothing | Fixed windows per color | Adaptive windows |
| Color tolerance | None (strict HSV ranges) | Configurable (20 default) |
| Plot area detection | None | Optional (can interfere) |
| Annotation masking | None | Optional (can remove valid data) |

### 3. **Coordinate Mapping Issues**
- **Legacy**: Simple, direct mapping using full warped image
- **Current**: Complex with plotting area offsets that could fail

## Optimizations Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm Restoration ✅

#### 1.1 Fixed Legacy Algorithm Implementation
- **Issue**: Subtle differences from original legacy GUI
- **Solution**: Restored exact coordinate mapping and smoothing behavior
- **Key Changes**:
  - Fixed coordinate mapping to use full warped image
  - Restored fixed smoothing windows (21 for red, 17 for blue, 13 for others)
  - Removed unnecessary grid size detection usage

#### 1.2 Simplified Enhanced Algorithm
- **Issue**: Over-engineered with conflicting features
- **Solution**: Combined legacy reliability with modern features
- **Key Changes**:
  - Used legacy boundary detection (proven to work)
  - Simplified plotting area detection with safety checks
  - Removed complex annotation masking
  - Restored legacy-style binning and smoothing

### Phase 2: API Endpoint Optimization ✅

#### 2.1 Multi-Strategy Approach
Implemented progressive strategy approach:

1. **Legacy First** (most reliable)
2. **Enhanced Conservative** (modern features with strict settings)
3. **Enhanced Relaxed** (moderate tolerance and plot area detection)
4. **Enhanced Very Relaxed** (maximum tolerance for difficult images)
5. **Auto-Color Clustering** (final fallback)

#### 2.2 Better Defaults
- `color_tolerance`: 0 (legacy compatibility)
- `min_size`: 1000 (matches legacy default)
- `mode`: "legacy" (most reliable)

### Phase 3: New Optimized Endpoint ✅

#### 3.1 `/api/curve-extraction/extract-curves-optimized`
- **Strategy**: Legacy → Enhanced (simplified)
- **Use Case**: Best balance of reliability and modern features
- **Features**:
  - Tries legacy first (most reliable)
  - Falls back to enhanced with user settings
  - Provides clear feedback on method used

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing ✅

#### 4.1 Comprehensive Documentation
- Created detailed README with usage examples
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Provided migration guide from legacy GUI
- Documented all endpoints and parameters

### Key Code Changes

#### Legacy Algorithm Fix
```python
# Legacy coordinate mapping - SIMPLE and DIRECT
if x_scale_type == 'linear':
    logical_x = xs * (x_max - x_min) / warped_size + x_min
else:
    f = xs / warped_size
    log_x = np.log10(x_min) + f * (np.log10(x_max) - np.log10(x_min))
    logical_x = 10 ** log_x

# Legacy uses fixed smoothing windows based on base color
smooth_win = 21 if base_color == 'red' else 17 if base_color == 'blue' else 13
```

#### Enhanced Algorithm Simplification
```python
# Use legacy boundary detection (proven to work)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Legacy-style processing with proven parameters
kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
cleaned = cv2.morphologyEx(warped_mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
cleaned = cv2.morphologyEx(cleaned, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/curve-extraction/extract-curves` (Main Endpoint)
- **Default Strategy**: Legacy → Enhanced → Auto-Color
- **Best for**: General use with automatic fallback

### 2. `/api/curve-extraction/extract-curves-legacy` (Guaranteed Compatibility)
- **Strategy**: Legacy algorithm only
- **Best for**: When you need guaranteed compatibility with original GUI

### 3. `/api/curve-extraction/extract-curves-optimized` (Recommended)
- **Strategy**: Legacy → Enhanced (simplified)
- **Best for**: Best balance of reliability and modern features

### 4. `/api/curve-extraction/extract-curves-llm` (AI-Assisted)
- **Strategy**: LLM-based extraction
- **Best for**: Complex graphs requiring AI interpretation
