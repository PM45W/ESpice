## Story

As a semiconductor engineer, I want to process multiple PDF datasheets in batch mode so that I can extract SPICE parameters from dozens of devices efficiently without manual intervention for each file.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Upload multiple PDF files (up to 50 files) simultaneously
- [ ] Process files in parallel using MCP server
- [ ] Show real-time progress for each file in the batch
- [ ] Display batch summary with success/failure counts
- [ ] Generate individual SPICE models for each successful extraction
- [ ] Export batch results as a single ZIP file
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully without stopping the entire batch

### Should Have
- [ ] Preview extracted parameters before final processing
- [ ] Allow selective processing of failed files
- [ ] Save batch configuration for reuse
- [ ] Email notification when batch completes

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Batch processing templates for different device types
- [ ] Integration with version control for batch results
- [ ] Batch performance analytics and reporting

## Tasks/Subtasks

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Create BatchUploadPage component with drag-and-drop multi-file support
- [ ] Implement BatchProgressTracker component for real-time progress
- [ ] Build BatchResultsView component for summary and individual results
- [ ] Add batch configuration modal for processing options
- [ ] Create batch export functionality with ZIP generation

### Backend Development
- [ ] Extend MCP service to handle batch requests
- [ ] Implement parallel processing with worker pool
- [ ] Add batch job queue management
- [ ] Create batch result aggregation and storage
- [ ] Implement batch error handling and recovery

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend batch UI with MCP server
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection for real-time progress updates
- [ ] Add batch processing to main navigation
- [ ] Integrate with existing document management system

## Dev Notes

- This story is the foundation for all automated data extraction and processing in the ESpice platform. Complete this before integration, data acquisition, or advanced UI/AI features.

### Technical Approach
- Use React Dropzone for multi-file upload
- Implement WebSocket connection for real-time progress
- Use worker threads in MCP server for parallel processing
- Store batch results in local database with batch metadata

### File Locations
- `src/pages/BatchProcessingPage.tsx` - Main batch processing page
- `src/components/BatchProgressTracker.tsx` - Progress tracking component
- `src/components/BatchResultsView.tsx` - Results display component
- `src/services/batchService.ts` - Batch processing service
- `src-tauri/src/batch_processing.rs` - Rust backend for batch operations

### Dependencies
- MCP server batch processing endpoints
- WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- ZIP file generation library
- Database schema for batch metadata

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for batch processing logic
- Integration tests with MCP server
- Performance tests for large batch sizes
- Error handling tests for various failure scenarios

## Testing

### Test Cases
- [ ] Upload 50 PDF files and verify all are processed
- [ ] Test error handling when some files fail
- [ ] Verify real-time progress updates
- [ ] Test batch export functionality
- [ ] Validate batch results accuracy

### Performance Targets
- Process 50 files in under 10 minutes
- Memory usage under 200MB during batch processing
- Real-time progress updates every 2 seconds

### Review Summary
This story provides a clear and actionable plan for implementing batch processing of PDF datasheets in ESpice. The requirements are well-structured, with a logical breakdown of frontend, backend, and integration tasks. Acceptance criteria are specific and testable, and the technical approach leverages modern best practices for parallel processing and real-time feedback.

---

### Strengths
- **Well-Defined Acceptance Criteria:** All major user needs (batch upload, parallel processing, error handling, progress tracking) are covered.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Tasks are clearly divided between frontend, backend, and integration, supporting modular development.
- **Technical Approach:** Use of worker threads, WebSockets, and ZIP export aligns with scalable, user-friendly batch processing.
- **Testing Requirements:** Explicit unit, integration, and performance tests are included, supporting robust delivery.
- **Performance Targets:** Realistic and measurable, ensuring the feature will be practical for real-world use.

---

### Risks & Gaps
- **Error Handling Depth:** “Handle errors gracefully” is broad. Recommend specifying user notification for failed files and logging for post-mortem analysis.
- **Scalability:** Processing 50 files is a good baseline, but consider documenting how the system will scale for larger batches in the future.
- **Resource Management:** Memory and CPU usage targets are set, but recommend adding monitoring and alerting for resource spikes.
- **Batch Configuration:** “Save batch configuration for reuse” is listed as a should-have; consider specifying the persistence mechanism (local storage, database, etc.).
- **Security:** No mention of file validation or security checks on uploaded PDFs. Recommend adding acceptance criteria for file type/size validation and basic security scanning.

---

### Recommendations
- Add acceptance criteria for user notification and logging of failed files.
- Specify the persistence mechanism for batch configuration reuse.
- Add acceptance criteria for file validation (type, size, security).
- Document monitoring/alerting for resource usage during batch processing.
- Consider a “future scalability” note in Dev Notes for handling larger batch sizes.

---

### QA Verdict
- **Testability:** All requirements are testable, but error handling and security should be more explicit.
- **Clarity:** Story is clear and actionable, with minor improvements suggested above.
- **Readiness:** Story is ready for development after incorporating the above recommendations.
