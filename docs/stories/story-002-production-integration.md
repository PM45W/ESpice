## Story

As a semiconductor foundry engineer, I want ESpice to be compatible with major foundry PDKs and EDA tools so that I can seamlessly integrate generated SPICE models into existing design workflows and ensure compliance with foundry requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Support for TSMC, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung PDK formats
- [ ] Export SPICE models in Cadence Spectre format (.scs)
- [ ] Export SPICE models in Synopsys HSPICE format (.sp)
- [ ] Export SPICE models in Keysight ADS format (.lib)
- [ ] Validate generated models against foundry requirements using at least one reference PDK per foundry (TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung)
- [ ] Include process corner variations (TT, FF, SS, SF, FS)
- [ ] Add temperature range support (-40°C to 175°C)
- [ ] Provide foundry-specific integration guides as part of documentation deliverables
- [ ] Ensure all new configuration panels (PDK selection, export config, etc.) meet accessibility and usability standards (UI/UX)

### Should Have
- [ ] Integration with Cadence Virtuoso through SKILL scripts
- [ ] Integration with Synopsys Custom Compiler
- [ ] Integration with Keysight ADS through AEL scripts
- [ ] Support for Monte Carlo analysis parameters
- [ ] Include model documentation and usage examples

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Direct integration with foundry design kits
- [ ] Automated model validation against silicon data
- [ ] Support for advanced process nodes (7nm, 5nm, 3nm)
- [ ] Integration with yield analysis tools

## Tasks/Subtasks

### PDK Integration
- [ ] Research and document PDK format requirements
- [ ] Implement PDK format parsers and generators
- [ ] Create PDK validation framework
- [ ] Add process corner and temperature variation support
- [ ] Implement Monte Carlo parameter generation
- [ ] Create and maintain a PDK version compatibility matrix and documentation

### EDA Tool Integration
- [ ] Develop Cadence Spectre export functionality
- [ ] Implement Synopsys HSPICE export
- [ ] Create Keysight ADS export capabilities
- [ ] Build SKILL script generator for Cadence integration
- [ ] Develop AEL script generator for Keysight integration

### Validation & Testing
- [ ] Create foundry compliance test suite
- [ ] Implement model validation against reference data, including at least one reference PDK per foundry
- [ ] Add automated regression testing
- [ ] Build performance benchmarking framework
- [ ] Create documentation and usage guides, including foundry-specific integration guides
- [ ] Ensure automated tests cover all process corners, temperature extremes, and Monte Carlo scenarios

### User Interface
- [ ] Add PDK selection interface
- [ ] Create export format configuration panel
- [ ] Implement validation results display
- [ ] Add integration status indicators
- [ ] Create foundry-specific templates
- [ ] Ensure all new UI panels meet accessibility and usability standards

## Dev Notes

- This story depends on the batch processing pipeline. Complete batch processing before starting PDK/EDA integration.

### Technical Approach
- Use industry-standard SPICE syntax for maximum compatibility
- Implement template-based model generation for different formats
- Create validation framework using foundry reference models
- Use plugin architecture for easy EDA tool integration

### File Locations
- `src/services/pdkService.ts` - PDK integration service
- `src/services/edaIntegrationService.ts` - EDA tool integration
- `src/components/PDKSelector.tsx` - PDK selection component
- `src/components/ExportConfigPanel.tsx` - Export configuration
- `src-tauri/src/pdk_integration.rs` - Rust PDK processing
- `mcp-server/pdk/` - PDK templates and validators

### Dependencies
- Foundry PDK documentation and reference models
- EDA tool documentation and APIs
- Industry-standard SPICE syntax specifications
- Validation framework for model accuracy

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each PDK format
- Integration tests with EDA tools
- Validation tests against foundry reference data
- Performance tests for large model generation

## Testing

### Test Cases
- [ ] Generate models for all supported PDK formats
- [ ] Validate models against foundry reference data
- [ ] Test EDA tool integration workflows
- [ ] Verify process corner and temperature variations
- [ ] Test Monte Carlo parameter generation

### Performance Targets
- Generate PDK-compatible models in under 30 seconds
- Support models with 1000+ parameters
- Validate models against reference data with 99% accuracy

## QA Results

---

### Review Summary
This story is well-structured and covers a comprehensive set of requirements for integrating ESpice with major foundry PDKs and EDA tools. The acceptance criteria are clear, actionable, and mapped to real-world foundry and EDA integration needs. Tasks and subtasks are logically grouped, and the technical approach is sound, leveraging industry standards and a plugin architecture for extensibility.

---

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria:** Covers all major foundry formats, export types, and validation needs.
- **Clear Task Breakdown:** Subtasks are actionable and map directly to acceptance criteria.
- **Technical Approach:** Use of template-based generation and plugin architecture is best practice for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Testing Requirements:** Explicitly calls for unit, integration, and performance tests, which is critical for this domain.
- **Performance Targets:** Realistic and measurable, supporting high-parameter models and fast validation.

---

### Risks & Gaps
- **PDK Format Complexity:** Each foundry’s PDK format can have subtle, version-specific differences. The story should explicitly call for a “PDK format versioning and compatibility matrix” as a deliverable.
- **Validation Depth:** “Validate generated models against foundry requirements” is broad. Recommend specifying at least one reference PDK per foundry for initial validation, and including regression tests for future PDK updates.
- **User Documentation:** While “usage guides” are mentioned, consider requiring “foundry-specific integration guides” for end users.
- **Automated Testing:** Monte Carlo and process corner support should include automated test coverage for edge cases (e.g., extreme temperature, process corners).
- **UI/UX:** The story lists UI tasks, but does not specify accessibility or usability requirements for the new interfaces (PDK selection, export config, etc.).

---

### Recommendations
- Add a task for “PDK version compatibility matrix and documentation.”
- Specify at least one reference PDK per foundry for initial validation.
- Require foundry-specific user documentation as a deliverable.
- Ensure automated tests cover all process corners, temperature extremes, and Monte Carlo scenarios.
- Add UI/UX acceptance criteria for accessibility and usability of new configuration panels.

---

### QA Verdict
- **Testability:** All major requirements are testable, but test cases should be expanded for edge conditions and versioning.
- **Clarity:** Story is clear and actionable, with minor improvements suggested above.
- **Readiness:** Story is ready for development after incorporating the above recommendations.
