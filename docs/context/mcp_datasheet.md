Model Context Protocol for Automated MOSFET Datasheet Extraction in Cursor
Objective
This protocol outlines the framework for integrating an AI-based tool for automated data extraction from MOSFET datasheets into the Cursor application, enabling power electronics design automation. The tool, inspired by the methodology in "Automated Extraction of Data From MOSFET Datasheets for Power Converter Design Automation" (Tian et al., IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 6, December 2024), aims to extract nonlinear dynamic properties from datasheet figures to enhance power loss modeling and streamline MOSFET selection for power converter designs.
Background
The referenced paper presents a novel end-to-end AI-based tool that extracts data from MOSFET and GaN HEMT datasheets using a CenterNet-based object detection system combined with optical character recognition (OCR) and morphological image processing. The tool processes datasheet figures, such as line charts, to extract key parameters and dynamic data, achieving an average relative error of 1.61% in test cases. This capability is critical for power electronics design, where accurate modeling of conduction and switching losses depends on precise datasheet data.
The protocol adapts this methodology for Cursor, ensuring it can process PDF datasheets, extract relevant data, and provide structured outputs for power converter design applications. The focus is on enabling Cursor to handle MOSFET datasheet figures, particularly monochromatic line charts, and integrate the extracted data into a machine-readable database for design optimization.

Model Context Protocol
1. Data Ingestion

Input: PDF files of MOSFET datasheets, containing figures such as line charts (e.g., I-V characteristics, capacitance vs. voltage, power loss curves).
Process:
Convert PDF pages to images using a library like pdf2image.
Store images in a temporary directory for processing.
Validate input PDFs to ensure they contain relevant figures (e.g., check for line charts using metadata or initial image analysis).


Output: A set of image files representing datasheet pages, ready for object detection.

2. Figure Segmentation

Objective: Identify and isolate line charts from datasheet pages.
Model: CenterNet (one-stage object detection neural network).
Process:
Load the pre-trained CenterNet model (trained on 2000+ annotated datasheet screenshots).
Pass each datasheet page image through CenterNet to detect figures, marked by bounding boxes with confidence scores (threshold: 0.4 for optimal F1-score, as per Table I in the paper).
Extract detected figures as separate images, preserving their context (e.g., page number, figure number).


Output: Isolated line chart images with associated confidence scores and metadata.

3. Key Element Detection

Objective: Identify key elements within each line chart (title, legend, corner, label, tick marks, others).
Model: Second CenterNet model (trained on 3800+ annotated line charts).
Process:
Pass each line chart image through the second CenterNet model to detect key elements.
Use confidence thresholds (0.4 for title, corner, label, tick; 0.3 for legend, others) to categorize detected elements, as per Table II in the paper.
Handle errors (e.g., misidentified labels or tick numbers) using additional verification (e.g., filtering non-numeric tick detections).


Output: Bounding box coordinates and categories for key elements, with confidence scores.

4. Text Recognition

Objective: Extract textual information from detected elements (e.g., titles, labels, tick mark values).
Tool: Tesseract OCR engine.
Process:
Apply Tesseract to bounding box regions containing text (e.g., title, labels, tick marks).
Group recognized text into x-axis and y-axis categories based on position.
Validate numeric tick mark values to ensure accuracy (e.g., filter out non-numeric detections).


Output: Structured text data (e.g., axis labels, tick values) linked to their respective positions.

5. Line Data Extraction

Objective: Extract dynamic data points from line charts (e.g., I-V curves, capacitance vs. voltage).
Tools: Morphological image processing (OpenCV), edge detection.
Process:
Binarization: Convert line chart images to binary format to isolate lines and grid.
Grid Removal: Apply morphological closing (dilation followed by erosion) to remove thin grid lines, preserving thicker data lines.
Line Skeletonization: Reduce lines to one-pixel width for accurate data point extraction.
Coordinate Mapping: Match extracted line data points to tick mark values using recognized axis coordinates.
Handling Monochromatic Charts: Skip color clustering for monochromatic figures, as most datasheet figures are grayscale.


Output: A set of (x, y) data points representing the line chart curves, mapped to physical units (e.g., current in A, voltage in V).

6. Data Structuring and Storage

Objective: Organize extracted data into a machine-readable format for power converter design.
Process:
Compile extracted data into a structured database (e.g., JSON, CSV, or SQLite).
Include parameters such as:
Conduction Loss Parameters: R_DS(on) (on-resistance), I_DS (drain-source current), temperature dependence (from Fig. 10).
Switching Loss Parameters: V_th (threshold voltage), g_m (transconductance), Q_oss (output capacitance charge), t_r, t_f (rise and fall times, from equations in Section V).
Graph-Derived Data: Points from I-V curves, capacitance vs. voltage, power loss vs. voltage/current (from Figs. 14, 15).


Associate data with datasheet metadata (e.g., manufacturer, part number).


Output: A structured database entry for each MOSFET, accessible for power loss modeling.

7. Integration with Cursor

Objective: Enable Cursor to use extracted data for power converter design automation.
Process:
Develop a Python module within Cursor to interface with the data extraction pipeline.
Implement API endpoints or function calls to:
Accept PDF datasheet inputs from users.
Trigger the extraction pipeline (steps 1–6).
Return structured data to the Cursor application.


Integrate with Cursor’s UI to display extracted parameters and curves, allowing users to select MOSFETs based on design requirements (e.g., minimizing power losses).
Provide error handling for cases where datasheets lack standard formats or contain errors (e.g., mismatched legends).


Output: A functional module within Cursor that processes datasheets and outputs data for design optimization.

8. Power Loss Modeling

Objective: Use extracted data to calculate conduction and switching losses for MOSFET selection.
Process:
Implement equations from the paper (Section V):
Conduction Loss: ( P_{\text{con}} = I_{\text{DS}}^2 \cdot R_{\text{DS(on)}} ), where ( R_{\text{DS(on)}} ) is temperature-dependent.
Switching Loss: Use equations for rise time (( t_r )), fall time (( t_f )), and charge/discharge times (( t_{rr}, t_{rf} )) based on ( V_{\text{th}}, g_m, Q_{\text{oss}} ).


Allow Cursor to compare power losses across multiple MOSFETs under varying conditions (e.g., voltage from 50–900 V, current from 5–80 A, as in Figs. 14, 15).


Output: Power loss estimates for each MOSFET, integrated into Cursor’s design workflow.

Validation and Testing

Training Validation: Verify CenterNet models achieve F1-scores comparable to those in Tables I and II (e.g., 0.9810–0.9966 for key elements at threshold 0.4).
Data Accuracy: Ensure extracted data has an average relative error of ~1.61%, as reported in the paper.
Test Cases:
Process a sample set of MOSFET datasheets to extract I-V curves, capacitance data, and power loss parameters.
Compare extracted data against manually verified datasheet values.
