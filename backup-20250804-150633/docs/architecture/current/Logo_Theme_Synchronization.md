# Logo Theme Synchronization Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the ESpice logo to be visible in both light and dark modes using the unified green theme color, ensuring consistent branding across all theme states.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Logo SVG Update - apps/desktop/src/assets/logo.svg
- **Before**: Used hardcoded `stroke="white"` and `fill="white"` colors
- **After**: Updated to use `stroke="#00b388"` and `fill="#00b388"` (ESpice green)
- **Result**: Logo now consistently displays in green color in both light and dark modes

### 2. Layout Component Integration - apps/desktop/src/components/Layout.tsx
- **Logo Styling**: Removed CSS color override since logo now has built-in green color
- **ESpice Text**: Updated brand text to use `text-[hsl(var(--primary))]` for consistency
- **Result**: Logo displays in green in both themes, brand text uses unified green theme color

### 3. Showcase Logo Verification - showcase/assets/logo.svg
- **Status**: Already properly themed with green background circle
- **Elements**: White elements are visible against green background
- **Result**: No changes needed - already follows theme system

## üîß Technical Implementation

### SVG Color System
Updated logo SVG to use ESpice green color instead of hardcoded white:
```svg
<!-- Before -->
<rect stroke="white" fill="white"/>

<!-- After -->
<rect stroke="#00b388" fill="#00b388"/>
```

### CSS Variable Integration
Logo now has built-in green color, brand text uses CSS variables:
```tsx
// Logo image (no color override needed)
className="transition-all duration-300"

// Brand text
className="text-[hsl(var(--primary))]"
```

### Theme Compatibility
