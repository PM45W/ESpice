# Enhanced Graph Extraction Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Enhanced Graph Extraction System, including service validation, performance benchmarking, and result validation.

## Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure you have:

1. **FastAPI Service Running**: The curve extraction service should be available at http://localhost:8002
2. **LLM Provider Setup**: At least one LLM provider (Ollama recommended) should be configured
3. **Test Images**: Sample semiconductor datasheet graph images for testing

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Service Connection Test

**Purpose**: Verify that all services are properly connected and available.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the Graph Extraction page
2. Ensure the service status shows "Available" (‚úÖ)
3. Click "üîç Test Connection" button
4. Review the test results

**Expected Results**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service connection test completed",
  "details": {
    "fastapi": { "status": "available" },

### 6. LLM Provider Comparison Test

**Purpose**: Compare different LLM providers for accuracy and performance.

**Steps**:
1. Test with Ollama (Local)
2. Test with OpenAI (if available)
3. Test with Anthropic (if available)
4. Compare results and processing times

**Expected Results**:
- All providers should successfully analyze the image
