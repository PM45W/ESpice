# Story 005: Semiconductor Device Web Scraping API and Data Storage

**Story ID**: ST-005  
**Sequence**: 3  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Assigned To**: Development Team  
**Created**: July 2025  
**Target Sprint**: November 2025

## Story

**As a** data engineer or researcher,
**I want** a fully functional web scraping API that can extract data for specific semiconductor device types (e.g., GaN HEMT, SiC, etc.) from online sources and store it in our database,
**so that** I can automate data collection, enable large-scale analysis, and keep our device database up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The API can scrape and extract relevant data for specified device types (e.g., GaN HEMT, SiC MOSFET) from multiple reputable online sources.
2. The API supports scheduling and on-demand scraping jobs.
3. Extracted data is parsed, cleaned, and normalized to a consistent schema.
4. All data is stored in the project’s database with proper indexing and deduplication.
5. The API provides endpoints for job management, status monitoring, and error reporting.
6. Scraping logic is modular and easily extendable to new device types or sources.
7. The system estimates and logs database usage (storage size, record count, growth rate) for each scraping job.
8. Security and anti-bot compliance (rate limiting, user-agent rotation, CAPTCHA handling) are implemented.
9. Documentation is provided for API usage, data schema, and extension guidelines.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design and implement scraping modules for GaN HEMT, SiC MOSFET, and other target device types (AC: 1, 6)
- [ ] Integrate multiple reputable data sources (AC: 1)
- [ ] Develop API endpoints for job creation, scheduling, status, and error reporting (AC: 2, 5)
- [ ] Implement data parsing, cleaning, normalization, and deduplication (AC: 3, 4)
- [ ] Store extracted data in the project database (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add database usage estimation and logging (AC: 7)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting, user-agent rotation, and CAPTCHA handling (AC: 8)
- [ ] Write API and data schema documentation (AC: 9)

## Dev Notes

- This story should be implemented after batch processing and PDK integration are complete, to ensure scraped data can be processed and integrated into the system.
- Use Python (FastAPI, Scrapy, or BeautifulSoup) or Node.js (Puppeteer, Cheerio) for scraping modules
- Store data in PostgreSQL or other project-standard database
- Use SQLAlchemy or Prisma ORM for schema management and deduplication
- Estimate database usage: For each device, expect ~1-5 KB per record (raw + normalized data, metadata, logs). For 10,000 devices, estimate 10–50 MB. Plan for growth and indexing.
- Reference: `services/web-scraper/`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/services/database.ts`

## Testing

- Unit and integration tests for scraping logic and API endpoints
- Data validation and deduplication tests
- Performance and load tests for large scraping jobs
- Security and anti-bot compliance tests
- Database usage estimation and logging verification
