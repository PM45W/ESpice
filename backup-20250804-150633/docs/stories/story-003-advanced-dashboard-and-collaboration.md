## Story

**As a** user or team member,
**I want** an optimized, customizable, and user-friendly dashboard/interface that works on all devices, with flexible layout, font, color, and theme options, plus authentication and team collaboration features,
**so that** I can tailor my workspace for productivity, accessibility, and seamless teamwork.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Users can customize dashboard layout (drag, resize, hide/show widgets/panels).
3. Users can change font, font size, color scheme, and overall theme (light/dark/custom themes).
4. The interface is fully responsive and user-friendly on all major devices and browsers.
5. User authentication system supports registration, login, password reset, and secure session management.
6. Team collaboration settings allow inviting members, assigning roles, and managing team workspaces.
7. All customization settings persist across sessions and devices (cloud sync).
8. Accessibility standards are met (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast, etc.).
9. Admins can manage users, teams, and permissions from a dedicated panel.
10. Comprehensive documentation and onboarding for dashboard customization and collaboration features.

## Dev Notes

- This story should be implemented after core backend, integration, and data acquisition features are complete, to ensure the dashboard can fully utilize all available data and services.
- Use a modern UI library (e.g., shadcn/ui, Material UI, or Chakra UI) for dashboard and customization components
- Leverage CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS (e.g., Tailwind) for theme and layout flexibility
- Use React Context or Redux for managing user preferences and theme state
- Authentication can use OAuth/JWT and integrate with backend user management
- Team collaboration features should leverage backend APIs for invites, roles, and workspace management
- Store user settings in cloud database (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or custom backend)
- Reference: `src/components/Dashboard/`, `src/services/authService.ts`, `src/services/teamService.ts`, `src/components/ThemeEditor.tsx`

## Testing

- Unit and integration tests for all customization and authentication features
- Cross-device and cross-browser UI/UX testing
- Accessibility audits (axe, Lighthouse)
- Security tests for authentication and permissions
- End-to-end tests for team collaboration flows
