# Story 004: Unified Product & Document Management with Enhanced Web Scraping

## Story
As a user, I want a unified interface that combines document and product management, allowing me to manually add products with file/folder organization, and seamlessly link to web-scraped products. I also want an enhanced web scraping function that consolidates Infineon, EPC, and TI scraping with selective file download capabilities and improved PDF viewing workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Unified Product-Document Interface**: Combine ProductPage and document management into a single, cohesive interface
- [ ] **Manual Product Creation**: Allow users to manually add products with custom metadata
- [ ] **File/Folder Organization**: Support multiple folders and files per product with hierarchical organization
- [ ] **Web Scraping Integration**: Link manual products to web-scraped data seamlessly
- [ ] **Consolidated Web Scraping**: Merge Infineon, EPC, and TI scraping into unified interface
- [ ] **Selective File Download**: Allow users to choose which files to download for each product
- [ ] **Enhanced PDF Viewing**: Implement PyMuPDF-based PDF processing with image extraction and HTML generation
- [ ] **Product Display Integration**: Show web-scraped products in the unified product page

## Dev Notes
- **Priority**: High - Core user experience improvement
- **Complexity**: Medium - Requires UI restructuring and service integration
- **Dependencies**: Existing web scraping services, datasheet service, PDF processing
- **Technical Approach**: 
  - Create unified ProductManagementPage component
  - Enhance web scraping service with selective download
  - Implement PyMuPDF-based PDF processing
  - Add file/folder management capabilities
  - Integrate with existing MCP server architecture

## Testing
- [ ] Test manual product creation with file uploads
- [ ] Test folder organization and navigation
- [ ] Test web scraping integration with selective downloads
- [ ] Test PDF viewing with image extraction
- [ ] Test cross-linking between manual and scraped products
- [ ] Test performance with large file collections
