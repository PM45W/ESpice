# 3. User Interface Design Goals

- **Batch-Oriented Workflow First**:
  Drag-and-drop upload, real-time batch dashboard

- **Visual Model Editor**:
  Digitized vs original curve overlay, live SPICE update

- **Minimalist Power UX**:
  Role-based views with engineering-native language

- **Accessibility**:
  Dark mode, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode

- **Progressive Onboarding**:
  First-run wizard, inline help, hide complexity by default
