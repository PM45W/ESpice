# Infineon GaN Scraper

This scraper is designed to download all datasheets from Infineon's GaN transistor page at:
https://www.infineon.com/products/power/gallium-nitride/gallium-nitride-transistor

## Features

- üöÄ Scrapes all GaN transistor products from Infineon's website
- üìÑ Automatically downloads datasheets (PDF files)
- üíæ Saves product information and metadata
- üîç Extracts specifications (voltage, current, power ratings)
- üìä Generates detailed reports of scraping results

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Standalone Script (Recommended)

The standalone script doesn't require the web service to be running:

```bash
cd services/web-scraper

# Run with default settings (up to 100 products)
python run_infineon_scraper.py

# Run with custom limit
python run_infineon_scraper.py 50
```

### Option 2: Web Service

If you want to use the web service API:

```bash
# Start the web scraper service
cd services/web-scraper
python main.py

# In another terminal, run the test script
python test_infineon_scraper.py
```

## Output

### Files Generated

The scraper creates the following structure:

```
datasheets/infineon/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scraping_results.json          # Complete scraping report
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product1_datasheet.pdf         # Downloaded datasheets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product2_datasheet.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Results JSON Structure

## API Endpoints (Web Service)

If using the web service, these endpoints are available:

### Start Scraping Job
```bash
POST /infineon/scrape-gan
{
  "max_products": 100,
  "include_datasheets": true
}
```

### Get Scraped Products
```bash
GET /infineon/products?limit=100
```

### Get Specific Product
```bash
GET /infineon/product/{part_number}
```

### Download Specific Datasheet
```bash
POST /infineon/download-datasheet
{
  "part_number": "IGT60R070D1"
}
```

### Monitor Job Status
```bash
GET /jobs/{job_id}
```

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting

The scraper includes built-in delays to be respectful to Infineon's servers:
- 2 seconds between product requests
- 30-second timeout for page requests
- 60-second timeout for datasheet downloads

### Error Handling

The scraper handles various error conditions:
- Network timeouts
- Invalid URLs
- Missing datasheets
- Parsing errors

All errors are logged and included in the final report.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service not responding**
   ```bash
   # Check if service is running
   curl http://localhost:8011/health
   ```

2. **No products found**
   - Check if the Infineon website structure has changed
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if the target URL is still valid

3. **Datasheets not downloading**
   - Some products may not have publicly available datasheets
   - Check if Infineon requires authentication for certain downloads
   - Verify the datasheet URLs are still valid

### Debug Mode

To see more detailed output, you can modify the script to include debug logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Legal Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This scraper is for educational and research purposes only. Please respect Infineon's terms of service and robots.txt file. The scraper includes reasonable delays to avoid overwhelming their servers.
